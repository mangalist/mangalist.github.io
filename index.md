### FAQ
Are the books scanlations?
: No. They are not scanlations or unauthorized fan translations. All manga and light novels are *official* English releases.

Are they pirated?
: No. They are acquired legally, as in bought for you using your money. If they're not for sale or they're on subscription/pay-per-chapter services like Renta! and NETCOMICS, I can't get them.

Are they physical books?
: No. The books are in digital format aka ebooks.

Why not just send files directly to my email address?
: Email services have attachment limits. For example, Gmail's is 25 MB. The average file size of a single-volume manga is 150 MB, so uploading files elsewhere is necessary.

Why are they so pricey?
: The short answer is: **retail price + exchange rate**. Some publishers sell their single-volume digital books for $9.99 or higher. That's over ₱500 for one manga. It's simply out of my hands. Rest assured I'm quoting the cheapest possible prices.

How do I read them?
: For light novels, any reading app will do. For manga, you'll need a comic reader app for your device. You may consult [this guide](https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/202844690) for starters.
